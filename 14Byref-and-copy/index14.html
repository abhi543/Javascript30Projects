  <p>All happen in console, we go deep how by reference and by copy(new memory) work</p>

  <div class="code">

    <pre>
    By memory or copying
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2); // 100 200
    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2); // 200 100

    let name ='brick';
    let name2 = 'prosma';
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "sdouarm";
    console.log(name, name2);
    </pre>

  </div>
  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name ='brick';
    let name2 = 'prosma';
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "sdouarm";
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;


    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    team[3] = 'Gomuvo';
    console.log(team);
    console.log(players); //BOOM , we change the players too, because array work by reference not copying as new memory.

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way use .slice() without param for make new copy 
    const team3 = players.slice() 
    team3[1] = 'puouyloa';
    console.log(team3);
    console.log(players); // See? 



    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    team4[0] = 'stev';
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players); // See? 



    // or use the new ES6 
    const team5 = [...players];
    team5[1] = 'asudsva';
    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players); // See? 


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
